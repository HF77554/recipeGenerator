# recipeGenerator

more of a search engine optimization project I want a database for my recipies that can do the following:

3 categories for recipies, drinks (alcoholic, coffee, etc), main (the most elaborate and tasties), side (things to compliment main) 

1) input ingredients which I can use to search for recipe options
2) search for recipe specifically by name or author
3) add favorites for easy access into personal profile
4) has profiles so people can input their own recipies which can be marked as public or private
5) be able to see all public recipies
6) comments can be made to recipe below but only original author can change the recipe and delete comments

For each recipe I would like detailed metrics for quantity which can be edited, and whose values can be changed to different units based on necessity
